Usage: minidcos docker wait [OPTIONS]

  Wait for DC/OS to start.

Options:
  -c, --cluster-id TEXT          The ID of the cluster to use.  [default:
                                 default]
  --superuser-username TEXT      The superuser username is needed only on DC/OS
                                 Enterprise clusters.   [default: bootstrapuser]
  --superuser-password TEXT      The superuser password is needed only on DC/OS
                                 Enterprise clusters.   [default: deleteme]
  --skip-http-checks             Do not wait for checks which require an HTTP
                                 connection to the cluster. If this flag is
                                 used, this command may return before DC/OS is
                                 fully ready. Use this flag in cases where an
                                 HTTP connection cannot be made to the cluster.
                                 For example this is useful on macOS without a
                                 VPN set up.  [default: False]
  --transport [docker-exec|ssh]  The communication transport to use. On macOS
                                 the SSH transport requires IP routing to be set
                                 up. See "minidcos docker setup-mac-network". It
                                 also requires the "ssh" command to be
                                 available. This can be provided by setting the
                                 `MINIDCOS_DOCKER_TRANSPORT` environment
                                 variable. When using a TTY, different
                                 transports may use different line endings.
                                 [default: docker-exec]
  -v, --verbose                  Use verbose output. Use this option multiple
                                 times for more verbose output.
  -h, --help                     Show this message and exit.
